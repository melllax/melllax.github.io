Watched  https://youtu.be/rf_mWl0pUP4?si=QXzk5bsPUFkXVnNH where director of science teaching and learning at Harvard describes their use of  #ChatGPT in #education. He opens by describing the role of “student questions during class” as “fundamental in shaping teaching and learning” and proceeds to making strong arguments for why this is the case. My own thoughts are very much aligned to his.
